# DL- Developing a Recurrent Neural Network Model for Stock Prediction
# NAME: CHARU NETHRA R
# REGISTER NUMBER: 21222320242
## AIM
To develop a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for predicting stock prices using historical closing price data.

## THEORY


## Neural Network Model
Include the neural network model diagram.

## DESIGN STEPS
### STEP 1: 

Load and normalize data, create sequences.

### STEP 2: 

Convert data to tensors and set up DataLoader.

### STEP 3: 

Define the RNN model architecture.

### STEP 4: 

Summarize, compile with loss and optimizer.

### STEP 5: 

Train the model with loss tracking.

### STEP 6: 

Predict on test data, plot actual vs. predicted prices.

## RESULT:
Thus, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model for predicting stock prices using historical closing price data has been developed successfully.
